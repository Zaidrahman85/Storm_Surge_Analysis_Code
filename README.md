# Storm_Surge_ Analysis _Code: 
This is the code described in Al-Attabi et al. 2022 (submitted) contains scripts that used to prepare boundary conditions data for model simulation, metrological forcing data, and storm surge damage analysis. The storm surge damage analysis is based on depth-damage function that estimate the proportion of flood damage based on the average flood height, dominant property type and total property value associated with each hexagon in map file. The depth- damage functions used is described in Huizinga et al (2017). This code uses regression fitting analysis to convert the binned depth-damage data in Huizinga et al (2017) to a continuous function applicable at any flood depth.
